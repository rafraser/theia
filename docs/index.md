# Theia

## Overview

Theia is a library designed to help out with automating image generation.
Theia currently has excellent functionality to help create.

This project is currently in a "pre-alpha" stage. At this stage, I've mostly designed it for personal usage, but I'm working towards making this library more versatile for other users.

Future plans for this library include better functionality for creating generative artworks.

## Getting Started

```bash
pip install rafraser-theia
```
